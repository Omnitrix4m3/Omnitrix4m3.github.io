							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Me-Four.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Studying Computer Science at the University of San Francisco has provided me the necessary experience to start applying the skills I have learned to more practical scenarios. I’ve had experience coding in Java, Python, C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with backend Java being my strongest suit. I started with building simple text-based games, then moving on to more sophisticated algorithms like developing a spellchecker and an implementation of ‘Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon’ using trees and graphs, to eventually building an in-memory search engine that exhibits my many years worth of foundational understanding in engineering as a single project. This allowed me to pursue an internship last summer as both a Software Engineer and Technical Program Manager with a travel company called Onriva. There I worked to refactor and debug parts of the company’s existing codebase and occupied a QA role of sorts. Additionally, I worked with C-level executives to migrate all development teams from the Waterfall methodology to an Agile workflow using the sprint-based Scrum framework. This led to a substantial increase in developer productivity. Most recently, I worked with Mapbox Inc. as well as teammates to develop a tool to convert GeoJSON map data into the highly scalable SVG file format, which has an unlimited number of applications for both personal and professional use. I have also become more comfortable with Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, and Software Development, having taken courses in such. I am also familiar with some development technologies such as Git, Github/BitBucket, Confluence, Jira, and Unix/Linux Operating Systems, which I consider to be helpful.</p>
							<p>Outside the realm of computer science, I find great joy in working with people. As a product specialist at Apple and a Sales Associate at Uniqlo, I learned the necessary skills to efficiently and productively work in a professional environment. Not only was I troubleshooting technical issues, but also had the responsibility of prioritizing the satisfaction of the customer, communicating in a respectful and collaborative way; a skill sometimes overlooked. Volunteering and being a youth leader at the Yaseen Foundation, a Muslim community-based organization I have been a part of since its opening, has allowed me also take leadership roles and work in teams to teach those either younger or less experienced than me.</p>
